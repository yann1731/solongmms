This project is very simple: Use a basic graphics library and make a top down game.

## Description

The constraints are that the character has to be blocked by walls and that all the collectibles need to be gathered before being able to finish the game.
Memory leaks of course are not allowed and neither are crashes. Program needs to be given a map as argument, the map needs to have extension .ber and to be square or rectangular in shape.

## Getting Started

Use make or make all.

### Dependencies

Coded on and for macOS x86_64. Should work on macOS arm64.

### Executing program

./solong /path/nameofthemap.ber
